# Student Performance Predictor

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on their scores, attendance, study hours, and extracurricular activities. It also provides data analysis and visualizations to understand student performance trends.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)

## Project Structure
- `data.csv` → Dataset with student scores and features  
- `student_performance_analysis.py` → Data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations  
- `student_performance_model.py` → Machine Learning model for predicting Pass/Fail  
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies  

## Features
- Computes **average scores** and **grades**  
- Generates **visualizations**: Average scores, Grade distribution, Feature correlation  
- Predicts **Pass/Fail** for new students using a **Random Forest model**  
- Prints **accuracy** and **confusion matrix** for model evaluation  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATOO7/Student-Performance-Predictor.git
